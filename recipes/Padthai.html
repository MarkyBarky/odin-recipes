<h1>Pad thai</h1>
<img src="../images/padthai.jpg" alt="yummy and savoury">
<p>Pad thai tastes amazing, especially the one in central called mali thai. Every shop that sells this 
  gives you so much quantity as opposed to buying meals you finish in 5 minutes. Not as good as sweet and 
  sour pork but a good alternative. Affordable and would give it a 9/10, 10/10 being sweet and sour pork.
</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<h3>for 3 servings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>6 oz. dry or fresh rice noodles, at least ¼ inch in thickness (4 oz or 100g per person)</li>
  <li>4 Tbsp. peanut or rice bran oil for frying (1 tbsp per person, because you’ll fry each portion separately)</li>
  <li>8 oz. pack of extra firm tofu cubed</li>
  <li>4 large eggs</li>
  <li>2 shallots diced</li>
  <li>1 bundle fresh scallions or garlic chives chopped into ½ inch pieces</li>
  <li>2 cups bean sprouts</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp fresh minced garlic</li>

  <p>Time Saving Tip: Cooking for a big group and don’t want to cook each portion separately? Stir fry all your small ingredients together (shallot, tofu, etc) and then add your proteins and get them fully cooked. Set this aside and use the empty wok to cook your noodles and egg in batches. As each ingredient finishes add it to a mixing bowl where you can mix the ingredients again before serving.</p>
  <p>Even the busiest street food stalls don’t make more than 1-2 portions of noodles per wok at a time. This is because if you rush the noodles and overload your wok, you end up with some noodles being overcooked, while others are terribly chewy. You can also swap your rice noodles for an easier type of noodle to cook in large quantities, like instant noodles. </p>
  
  <h3><strong>Pad Thai Sauce</strong></h3>
  <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
  <li>½ cup diced shallots</li>
  <li>¾  cup fresh tamarind pulp</li>
  <li>¼ cup water (to adjust the texture of the tamarind pulp)</li>
  <li>3-4 Tbsp. palm sugar</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp. fish sauce</li>
  <li>pinch of white pepper and dried chili flakes to taste</li>
  <li>pinch of paprika for color</li>

  <h3><strong>Optional Ingredients & Garnish</strong></h3>
  <li>8 oz. protein of choice (most commonly shrimp or chicken)</li>
  <li>⅓ cup small dried shrimp (1 tbsp per person)</li>
  <li>1 limes cut into wedges (1 lime wedge to garnish each plate)</li>
  <li>Crushed unsalted peanuts</li>
  <li>Dried red chili flakes</li>
  <li>Extra bean sprouts, garlic chives, and banana blossom for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h1>Preparation</h1>
<p>Fully submerge and soak dry noodles in cold water for 20 minutes. If using fresh noodles, soak for 10 minutes. Once noodles are al dente, strain and set aside. If soaked too long, noodles will become gummy to the touch. Prep additional ingredients in advance.</p>
<p>Pad Thai is traditionally cooked very quickly over high heat, so laying out all ready ingredients is essential for a quality dish.</p>

<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Heat large wok on high. Add 1 tbsp oil, shallots, meat, dried shrimp and 2 oz. tofu. Cook for approximately 3 minutes until browned and protein is cooked all the way through, remove meat and set aside. Add in ½ tbsp garlic, 4oz. noodles, 1 cup sauce stirring vigorously until noodles soften. You can add in a little bit of water to help soften. Throw in ½ cup bean sprouts, pinch of garlic chives, and mix thoroughly.</p>
<p>Push your noodles over to one side of the wok, leaving one side clear and crack 1 egg directly into opening, scramble and cook to 80% — do not fold in. Turn down heat to low. Fold noodles over and set directly on top of egg, about 30 seconds to finish cooking. Remove from heat. Plate noodles, add extra chives, peanuts, chili flakes and lime wedges on top for garnish.</p>
<p>Eat and enjoy!</p>
